"""Snap mis-read names to the names you're likely saying, by how they *look* on the lips.

Lip reading can't hear, so "Miguel" comes out as MCCALL / MC HALE / NICKEL. Those differ in
letters but not in lip shapes. Each word is mapped to a coarse viseme sequence (lip/tongue shape
classes, from spelling — no pronunciation dictionary needed), and a span of 1–2 read words is
replaced by a candidate name when their viseme sequences are close. Only uncommon words are
eligible, so ordinary words ("my", "tool") are never swapped.
